# Logic Gate Simulator

This project simulates electronic circuits made up of logic gates, written in Python with the pygame library.

The user can drag and drop logic gates including NOT, AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR and XNOR gates into a circuit, and connect them up as desired along with a series of inputs (A, B, C...) and an output (X). The simulator will then generate a boolean expression for the completed circuit, and show the correct output for a combination of inputs.
